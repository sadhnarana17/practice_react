text2: With an initial timeline of 3 months for the MVP the Heero app went into review with the App stores a little over 2 months into the project meaning I’ve had time to make tweaks based on Apple / Google feedback without running over budget. The quality of build is fantastic and having a team dedicated to my project makes it a lot easier to get things done.

text3: Our partnership with ucreate has been extremely valuable. From the rapid MVP build, to challenging assumptions and latterly, the ability to scale the business at short notice. A dedicated team with a proven track record at such a fragile time in our existence was a great comfort. ucreate have become deeply and intrinsically involved in our business offering support across the technology landscape and beyond.
